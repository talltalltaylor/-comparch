This is a Disassembler simulator written in Python to accept a list of specified ARMv8 instructions as input, and output a valid text file of translated assembly instructions. 

USAGE:

To run this program in a Linux environment, you will need Python 2.7.14 for your environment, and you will need a valid set of machine code instructions in a .txt file. One is provided in our solution for testing/demo purposes. After downloading team11_project1.py, including the input file, you can run the Disassembler from the terminal.

The command to run the program is as follows:

python team11_project1.py -i text.txt -o out

The script will echo the input file name and output the results to out.txt.
